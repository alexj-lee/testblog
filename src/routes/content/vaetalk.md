I gave this talk for a journal club on new methods in VAE research, mostly from reading the paper [Provable concept learning for interpretable predictions using variational autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00492). I think the paper is really interesting and I learned a lot from it. I then read some of the papers ([Khemakhem et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04809) and [Locatello et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12359)) which really were informative--I've since quite enjoyed reading papers from the same labs (Scholkopf and Hyvärinen). Particularly Hyvärinen, because of their innovation (which I had not been aware of) in ICA, or independent components analysis, which I used quite a lot during my fMRI analysis projects. Coincidentally I also found that Hyvärinen worked on sliced score matching back in the early 2000s and has since done a lot more research in the foundations of identifiable, (more) interpretable deep learning models. 

The presentation is probably better viewed in its standalone form at this link: [here](https://alexj-lee.github.io/identifiability-vae-presentation/idvae#/title-slide). You can also fullscreen it if you are in Chrome by pressing the "f" key while interacting with the presentation.
