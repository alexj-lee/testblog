I gave this talk for a group of undergrads interning in the Abbasi lab for the semester. I had a good time reviewing some of the papers that I think are interesting in this area. To be clear, I am not an expert in protein language modeling or protein biophysics (although I spent a lot of time thinking about the physics of specific peptide drugs while at Nano Precision, for formulation reasons).  A lot of the work was done by the Marks lab at Harvard--some really amazing researchers there--really the type of computational biologists I would like to be.

The presentation is probably better viewed in its standalone form at this link: [here](https://alexj-lee.github.io/plmpresentation/). You can also fullscreen it if you are in Chrome by pressing the "f" key while interacting with the presentation.
